# Project 3 Dynamic Graph | Data Structures
Realization of a dynamic data structure that allows operations to be performed on a directed graph

# Project 3 - Data Structures

- Chose to share this project as an example, to reflect my thought process and coding abilities with regards to:

	- Implementation of data structures
	- Establishing a dynamic data structure architecture
	- Object Oriented Programming
  - Implementation of important Algorithms
  
  
## How to review

- I recommend starting from reading the project assignment overview guidlines, to understand the project and its purpose
- Next, review the project according to the sequence described in the assignment: starting from the construction of the basic data structures, through the elaborated data structure, to the algorithms implemented in it respectively (you can run the test and the output to refine the understanding)
